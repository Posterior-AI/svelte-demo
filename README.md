## 🗂️ Workspace & Project Management

### 📱 Workspace Overview

The UI is segmented into three productivity-maximizing panes:

| Pane | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Code Editor** | Left | Full-featured editor with direct code access. All AI-generated code appears here, ready for manual refinement. |
| **AI Assistant** | Center | Command center for the AI. Select your model, operating mode, and use Quick Actions to drive development. |
| **Live Preview** | Right | Real-time, interactive preview of your application. Changes render instantly without manual compilation. |

> **💡 Tip:** Panes are resizable – drag the borders to customize your layout!

### 🎨 Visual Editing Mode ✨

Bridge the gap between design and development with **Visual Editing Mode**:

1. Click on any element in the Live Preview (text, buttons, images)
2. Modify them on the spot
3. Changes are **automatically written back** to your source code

Perfect for quick UI tweaks and content updates without touching the code editor!

### 🎮 Project Controls

Essential controls in the top-right corner:

- **Restart** 🔄 - Restarts the development server
- **Stop** ⏹️ - Halts the development server
- **Delete** 🗑️ - Deletes the current project instance

### 📚 Change History & Version Control

Built-in version control located in the top-left corner:

1. Click **Save**
2. Enter a descriptive message (e.g., "Implement user login form")
3. A version snapshot is created and logged in the **Changes History**

**Instant rollback capability** – select any previous version to restore your project to that state.
